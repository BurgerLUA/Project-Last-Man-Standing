<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>Regardless of your skill level, years of experience in the field, or age, NanoTrasen welcomes all soliders, engineers, scientists, medical doctors, and assistants to the field of battle. If any assistance is required, feel free to ask your fellow soliders or consult the Station's Library for guides, or refer to this guide if you wish to know the basics.</p>

<h2>Arriving</h2>
<p>Upon arriving to the station, you may feel a little disoriented at first. Here at NanoTrasen, we value independence as well as free-thinking, so we implanted loyalty implants in your head as well as IFF chips in your left hand to prevent you from falling to Syndicate influence. Unless removed, you will unable to be injured or targeted by other NanoTrasen personnel. NanoTrasen must legally inform you that any hints of existence of a hidden "rage cage" in medical maintenance is entirely facetious and should be ignored.</p>

<h2>Your Duties</h2>
<p>As a NanoTrasen Mercenary, your duties will change from day to day, mission to mission, based on the needs and desired of NanoTrasen and their subsidiaries. Potential objectives include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Artifact Retrieval</li>
  <li>Hostage Rescue</li>
  <li>Megafauna Assassination</li>
</ul>  
<p>In order to perform your duties, you should be visiting different departments and purchasing goods based on your operation style. Those who have a strong passion for engineering should visit the engineering department (located northwest of the station) where they can purchase the tools and materials to build to their hearts content, while those who are medically inclined should visit the medical bay (located southeast of the station) to purchase healing supplies to help their fellow man in need. If you are simply good at killing, or wish to defend yourself while performing certain duties, it would be wise to visit the armory (located northeast of the station) or the science department (located southwest of the station) to purchase weapons and ammunition to support yourself.</p>
