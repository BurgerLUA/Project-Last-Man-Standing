## What is enchanting?
Enchanting is using the dark arts in order to improve your weapons and equipment to absurd levels that go beyond the manufacturer's intent. Caution should be made while doing this as effects are usually unpredictable and irreversible.

### To enchant objects, you need the object you wish to enchant, a filled soulgem, and an enchanting book, and an enchanting circle drawn with special chalk.

## Soul Gems
Soulgems power the strength of your enchantments. They can be obtained by magical creatures, such as meatmen.

### Enchanting Book
Enchanting books determine the type of your enchantment, as well as the activation phrase for the enchantment. These books are rare and old artifacts sometimes carried by wizards.

## Enchanting Circle
Enchanting circles is the special magic that brings everything together. They can be drawn by special chalk found in magic vendors.

## How to Enchant
In order to enchant an object, draw an enchanting circle at your feet in an open area with the special chalk you purchased from a magic vendor. Secondly, read the enchanting book to learn the special activation phrase in order to complete the enchanting ritual. Then, place a soul gem, the enchanting book, and the object you wish to enchant in each of the circles. It is fine if there is one circle empty, as those are only used for special enchantments that require an additional object. Once you've placed everything where they should be, activate the enchanting circle with your hand to start the ritual. Note that if an object is moved or removed from the circle during the ritual, you will need to clear the enchanting circle and start the ritual all over again! Once the rune glows, quickly say the enchanting ritual phrase. Items will magically disappear if the ritual was done correctly, if not, the rune will vanish and you will need to restart the process again.
