<h2>Your Duties</h2>
<p>As a Bravo squad member, you will be tasked with constructing and defending the landing zone of the Bravo ship, as well as managing cargo on the Bravo shuttle. While some crewmembers might argue otherwise, Bravo is the most important role planetside as mission failure is based on whether or not you can construct good base defences.</p>

<h2>Base Construction</h2>
<p>In order to have a successful mission, a successful Forward Base of Operations (FOB) must be constructed. There will be times in the mission where all squads must retreat to the Forward Base of Operations in order to organize a defense or a rally against the hostile lifeforms. Generally, the base itself must be accessible by all, but still secure from hostile elements. In order to fulfill this goal, you must utilize barricades, walls, floors, windows, and even doors to protect the base from intruders.</p>

<h2>Base Defence</h2>
<p>Base Defence isn't just about sitting around and protecting a a barricade; Base defence duties also involve going out in patrols to eliminate scouting parties around the location in order to prevent a base attack from ever happening.</p>

<h2>Cargo Management</h2>
<p>The Bravo shuttle is designed to move large amounts of cargo to and from the main ship in a speedy manner. Most of the cargo that will be sent planetside will include resources such as ammo, medical supplies, construction materials, mechs, and weapons. In the mission, other squads may find objects of interest that can be delivered to the Bravo shuttle, and then the main ship's cargo bay, and then to Central Command, for a boost in supplies.</p>
