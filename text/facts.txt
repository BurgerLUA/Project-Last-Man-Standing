Burgerstation was created as a joke during December 2019. Some scholars say it still is.
Burgerstation was going to be a PvP heavy RPG called "The Realm of Nar'sie" but they thought that was a bad idea.
The early tests for Burgerstation was a team-based deathmatch with limited weapons.
BurgerBB has two todo lists; one on Trello and one on a noteboard attached to a wall near his computer.
BurgerBB made all the menu music for Burgerstation, but can't make combat music to save his life.
The server running Burgerstation is hosted inside a cardboard pizza box. This isn't a joke.
The first Burgerstation map was a detailess flat grass area. The first public Burgerstation map was a bunch of houses with sabre swords in them.
The sabre sword was the first weapon in Burgerstation.
You can download and play the very first version of Burgerstation here: https://github.com/BurgerLUA/burgerstation/releases/tag/1.1
Did you know that Byond Games can be played in your browser? I don't recommend it.
BurgerBB, being the sole Host, Head Admin, and Head developer, is one of the few hosts who has access to Hostchat as well as the Headcoderbus.
