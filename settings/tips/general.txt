All items you craft are soulbound, which means they do not drop on death. Items you find in the world, are not, unless soulbound to someone else.
Soulbound items are attached to your BYOND account, rather than your character. 
Clothes that provide no physical armor protection are often very resistant against magic.
Weapons that deal "fatigue" damage are non-lethal and directly damage the target's stamina. A mob who has no stamina and is hit with a stamina damaging attack will be knocked out for 30 seconds, and then fully rejuvenated and immune to stamina dealing attacks for an entire minute.
